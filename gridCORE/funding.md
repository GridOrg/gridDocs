## Intro Status Quo 

The GRID is a non-commercial collaborative.
Currently, there is no financial dimension involved besides individual efforts.
Gridsters do not receive any salary or incentives, all efforts are based on voluntary basis.

For small groups this works out pretty well.
When the GRID grows to a critical size, then the approach needs to be reviewed incrementally.

What we are doing is preparation for that point in time.
We consider different options connected to Co-/Funding, collaborative Budgeting and we are researching on all relevant legal and compliance related aspects.
