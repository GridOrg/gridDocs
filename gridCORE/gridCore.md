## gridCORE

### Intro to Subgrids

	* What are [subgrids](../gridMechanics/subgrids.md) and why are they?

### Intro to the gridCORE

The gridCORE is a subgrid, but has some focus areas to keep the GRID running.

### Special function of the gridCORE

The gridCore is a subgrid, but with special purpose.
As most subgrids are active in a certain area of interest of focussed on a special agenda, the gridCore is meant to be the opposite.
It can be understood as a service and administrative function of or better for the GRID.

#### Service function

* Caring about the overall GRID as collective of Gridsters
* Identification of new needs, requirements, impediments or opportunities connected to the GRID evolution
* Research on methods and tools to support the daily collaboration
* Promotion and communications connected to the GRID
* Pushing concepts and ideas which are interesting for more than one subgrid
* Helping to maintain and grow each subgrid with a focus on quality
* Maintaining the general boards containing grid values, grid agenda, BOGI etc.
* General interface for any concerns, input, improvement areas, challenges


#### Administrative function

* _IF AND WHEN NEEDED:_ Covering aspects like ...
	* Funding / Budget / Compliance

### Who is able to join the gridCORE

In general every gridster is able to show interest in special functions for the GRID.

That a person is promoted to cover or care about a dedicated area of responsibility typically just happens over time.
For new challenges people we trust will be most likely asked to take a certain responsibility, like in any other social organism.

Today, there is no formal procedure, because this would also be a formal overhead which implies some sort of political nature of the roles involved.
Since this is not the purpose, we rely on interpersonal skills to find the right persons for functions, which require a certain level of reliability, integrity etc.

But as any other subgrid, also the gridCORE is open for changes and will face evolution. It is not a static construct, but necessary in regards to keeping things on track.
