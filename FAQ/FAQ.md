### What Are Subgrids?

Subgrids are groups or hubs of the GRID.

Typically subgrids have a special focus area or are formed based on a certain discipline / approach.
The GRID is the meta-layer in which all subgrids are embedded. A gridster could be part of one or many subgrids.
Each subgrid has a mentor, this role is needed to maintain the subgrid and to trigger activities or organize routines.
The coreGRID is a special subgrid, responsible for general administration and support of the GRID.
All subgrids vary and might have own special routines, but all subgrids are compatible to values, routines and agreements of the GRID.

No. Not right now.
We aimed for a transparent and collaboration friendly Handbook. That's why we have chosen a git repository.

### How To Contribute To The Handbook?

If you are familiar with git, then reach out to teriell or one of the mentors for a short intro.
If you don't know how to work with github or git repositories, then ask one of the techGRID people, if they could show you the main concepts.
Alternatively, you can always reach out to gridCORE members to assist.
