## How To Join The GRID?

Gridsters usually got promoted and invited by other Gridsters.
Besides invitation, we offer some generic touchpoints where you can show interest.

- Via Mail you can reach out to [gridcore@into-the-grid.org](gridcore@into-the-grid.org)
- Via [form](http://bit.ly/FollowThePurpleRabbit) you can attend to become a gridster, this is the easiest way for us to follow-up 


## Who Is Able To Invite New People?

Every gridster is free to promote people for invitation.

The GRID grows intentionally through invitation at this stage.
We think it is a good indicator, if people promote new gridsters based on their own social connections.

Every gridster is free to promote others. 

New subgrid invites are usually triggered by the mentor, who needs to know the subgrid member list. 
The coreGRID tries to maintain the GRID in its growth and therefore tracks incoming requests.
If gridsters promote / invite people, then it helps to inform the relevant roles / gridsters, so that we all stay up-to-date.


## Who Is Able To Join?

Everyone is able to connect to the GRID.

We are open for all people of any cultural or personal background.
We do not prefer certain skills or capabilities, even though we are happy to see creative, self-managed people with high motivation to do cool stuff :)

The GRID requires our shared activity, contribution and the openness for teamwork.
If you are open-minded, willing to meet other people, intrinsically motivated to join shared activities, then you are a good match.

The GRID is in an early stage and that is why we try to focus on a natural growth we are able to sustain in a productive way.
Because of this, we potentially will not accept all attendees.



### Exceptions

The only *exception* is, that we do not see any compatibility to racists, homophobes, fascists or in general those idiots, who decided to follow exclusionary, harming or poisoning ideas. We hate the reactionary mindsets, we don't like narrow-minded thinking. We don't want to see trolls.

Don't try to connect, if you are infected by one of these irritations.
