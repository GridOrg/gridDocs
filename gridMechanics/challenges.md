## Challenges

Challenges can be announced by every gridster.
A challenge could be compared like a bounty, quest or ... challenge.

### How Are Challenges Defined?

* Challenges are timely framed, precisely described tasks, which are handed over to the crowd as a challenge.
* Each challenge can become a success or failure, depending on the participation, contribution or the attractiveness of the challenge itself.
* A challenge can be announced by each gridster. Each gridster can announce as many challenges as she / he wants to.
* Each challenge announced need to consist of the following information:
	* Headline, Description, Run-Time (with start and end date), Desired Outcome, Challenge Success Criteria, additional infos as needed
	* Implicitly each challenge has an author - the challenger
* A challenge is always GRID-wide. 
* When a challenge is over, it needs to be evaluated, if the challenge was met and mastered or if the crowd failed on the challenge.
	* Failing does not automatically mean, that the gridsters really did bad, it could also mean, that no one was interested in the challenge.

### Perspective

As a starting point, we will use a Trello board for the challenges.
BUT - the challenges should be represented in a cool and handy way, optimized for this usage.
So it could be, that the challenge will become a feature of the GRID OS, or a dedicated piece of software. 

### Examples

#### Example 1: Badges

**Challenge:**

We search badge-designs.

**Description:**

Gridsters want to highlight special skills or experiences, supportive behaviour or valuable contributions among other gridsters.
So, as a form of kudos, badgets shall be introduced. Badges can be attached to gridster-profiles and will be visible throuhout the GRID.
Badges can be earned through activity or received as kudo by other gridsters.
To make this more fun and appealing, badges need to be fun and we would like to have a great repository of cool badge designs.
To build up this repository, we launch the BADGE CHALLENGE.

Each design should be connected to a topic and a level. The idea behind is explained at ... and the topics (and levels) can be found here ...
(Of course you can propose more topics, but this is not the main part of this challenge).

**Run-Time:** 5 weeks.

Start-date: xx.xx.xxxx
End-date: yy.yy.xxxx

**Outcome:**

The Badge-Challenge Round 1 is about collection of designs.

A follow-up Challenge, if enough designs are provided, is about the nomination of the winning designs.
We will announce and present the outcome as soon as possible.
The follow-up Challenge will be introduced after Round 1.

**Challenge Success Criteria:**

We can collect at least x cool designs.

**Further infos:**
Please use this ... design-template / guideline, so that all designs will meet the usage criteria.

#### Example 2: I need help on a text tranlsation


**Challenge:**

We wrote a subgrid-text on ...

**Description:**

In the subgrid we do not have any english native speakers.
We need a review and we are really happy for input / feedback.
It would be super, if we find at least 1-2 contributors here.

**Run-Time:** 2 weeks.

Start-date: xx.xx.xxxx
End-date: yy.yy.xxxx

**Outcome:**

Minimal outcome would be a quick review to prevent big text problems.
Cool would be if a native speaker can go through the text in detail to make changes.
For the cool - option, we would invite you to the team and discuss more details in advance.

**Challenge Success Criteria:**

The text is good enough for english audience.

**Further infos:**
Current size is somewhere between x-y words.


### Overlap To Initiatives Or BOGI Items?

[Initiatives](./initiatives.md) or [BOGI](./bogi.md) items can contain similar _challenges_, but the format is different regarding the collaboration.
Initiatives are not necessarily timely framed problems to solve. Initiatives are focussed on the outcome and require the formation of a team, orchestrated by the initiator. An initiatve could led to a spin-off, which would include dozens of challenges. So, initiatives are potentially more heavy-weighted, complex, deeper intented and the format of initiative is less templatized. Initiatives could be limited to a subgrid, challenges are always GRID-wide.

BOGI items could easily contain a challenge. The BOGI can be used for various topics, that's why it also could integrate challenges.
The BOGI itself is more a lean approach for the collection, discussion and selection of items, for example for innovation candidates.
That is why the BOGI cannot be compared to the Challenge-idea, where each challenge will either be taken by the crowd or not.
