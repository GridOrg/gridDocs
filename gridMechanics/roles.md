## Roles

For the entire GRID various concepts exist. It might be that this will change, because of the evolution of the GRID or in subgrids.
The same is true for roles, which might exist. Roles are not meant to exist forever, so that there is no special legitimation in roles besides the formalization of a special attention and the need for a certain area of responsibility. Roles are not hierarchically organized, as the GRID has no organizational structure, like a pyramid hierarchy. 
In most cases roles are connected to mechanics or concepts, and therefore are idealized, so that there is not always a need to have these roles.
For example, if a subgrid would be super-small in size (let's say only two people are part of this particular subgrid), then the maintenance work would perhaps be shared among these people and less formaized. In addition the efforts would perhaps be super-low. So if a [subgrid](./subgrids.md) typically would be connected to the responsibilites of a mentor role, then this is always a formal description, which requires a second review against real needs. Roles are proposals and the desciption of a common sense, like other mechanics.

### Existing Roles

* The [gridCore](../gridCORE/gridCore.md) has administrative and service functions, which can be considered as roles, even though these responsibilities are not named separately
* Each [subgrid](./subgrids.md) has a mentor, who needs to serve the subgrid in various purposes
* Each [initiative](./initiative.md) starts with the initiator, a role which is connected to accountability for the sake of the initiative
* The [BOGI](./bogi.md) is proposed as a generic concept, which also names roles, for instance a moderator role. These are not binding and only a proposal in the BOGI-context

### Who Takes A Role?

* For initiatives and subgrids it is defined, that these roles should be in place, so that the construct of subgrid or initiative can be pushed on the basis of accountability in a minimal scenario - meaning, one person should be found to push things forward. Which person this might be, is not specified. The group needs to find a way to discuss a good setup here, for instance on a consensus basis, but it is also very natural and legit, that the author of a new idea wants to be accountable for the pushing of this idea. It is fair, to allow this, even though it is fair, if people raise concerns in a constructive fashion. Roles are equipped with some special rights, e.g. administrative rights, but roles are not meant to be concepts of unfair power. It has to be understood, that misuse of such administrative rights cannot be the right approach in the GRID. So in case of concerns only a fair discussion can be a solution here.
* Every gridster is able to show accountability and the will to take a role. As the GRID is not a company, roles are not paid. So volunteering for roles is important. If one takes a role, she or he will not be measured by KPI's. Together we want to create an environment which makes sense for all, but allows the individual progress also. Meaning, roles are also a good way to try something new. That's possible.

### How To Raise The Need For New Roles?

* When there is a neeed for new roles, we just should discuss this. The right forum for this is the gridCore group, if the proposal is connected to general / grid-wide needs.
* Subgrid-roles can be discussed within the subgrid of course. It makes much sense to integrate the mentor to this discussion.
* Initiative related roles can be defined as it is needed for the initiative. Here again, it makes sense to integrate the initiator to this discussion.

### Remarks

* We do not want to establish unnecessary bureaucraty, nor complex formalization. So do not propose roles if there is no need.
* Roles are no power concepts, but roles require a certain level of empowerment to be fulfilled. Misuse of powers needs fair discussions.
* Roles shall not become a barrier for evolution of practicalities, shared procedures or new approaches. On the contrary, roles shall help to assist in evolution.
* Roles satisfy the need of having real contact partners for certain issues, questions, purposes. A positive attitude towards the usage of roles strengthens the GRID as social platform.
