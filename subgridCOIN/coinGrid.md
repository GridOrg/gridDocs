## coinGRID

The coinGrid will combine two tracks:
1) Working on new business ideas, which might become spin-offs
2) Collaboration between Freelancers of Self-employed gridsters

The GRID as such is a non-commercial community. The coinGrid takes into account, that people have to have income.
Additionally, we want to support people who take the risk of an own approach to income and those, who want to work on great ideas.
In conclusion, founding a business and being a gridster is not a conflict.

We hope, that the GRID helps to create a generation of better businesses.
Businesses for people taking responsibiliy and thinking in a bigger picture.
We hope, to contribute to nature of work in a positive way, so that this aspect of human reality can become more than money-making.

Nevertheless, the coinGrid is a subgrid as all other [subgrids](../gridMechanics/subgrids.md). Meaning, it will also implicitly contribute to the overall Grid and is not only a melting pot for new business ideas or professional collaboration.

## Status

The coinGrid conceptually is shaped, but currently we focus on ramping-up the techGrid and artGrid.
At the moment, we lack of necessary people who are qualified and have suffiecent capacity to launch the coinGrid.
