## Paradigms And Beliefs

Paradigms and beliefs and not the GRID VALUES.

A collections of **paradigms** shall help to discuss, dis-/agree, work in the context of our values.
The paradigms shall also help to identify potential areas for improvement, clarification of differentiation.

The collection of paradigms has no binding function, no paradigm can be used in a dogmatic way, no paradigm is written in stone.


**Beliefs** are mental representations of what we think is true or should be true. 
This area is more motivated by moral aspects, personal attitudes towards a context and positioning.
That also means, beliefs are no proven facts based on empirical evidence, but unproven hopes or ideas connected to declared values.
The GRID as such, is not tight to any form of religion, even though it accepts individual beliefs.
We think that it is important and valuable to share individual beliefs, even though we know that it is hard to discuss beliefs in the context of more objective arguments or facts.
But as humans, we are convinced, that beliefs are important assets to integrate into a bigger picture.


### Paradigms

* Ideas are enablers for societies to change.
* Nations are historical ideas, which are already discplaced by concepts of a globalized world.
* Mechanisms of evolution are competition and collaboration. The success of the human species of today is essentially caused by collaboration.
* We are moving into an era in which the concept of decentralized organization (of social activity, of technology, ef economy, of power etc.) will become normal.
* The human species (of the current size) can no longer sustain itself without the help of technology. 
* Technology creates new complexity and determines the individual being.
* Technological progress happens faster than cultural change and progress.
* Models like economical growth and the accumulation of power have become threats to the human existence and should be enhanced by the concepts of limitation, sustainability and collective responsibility. 
* Education is not sufficiently preparing children towards their future challenges or opportunities, it is preparing children for a concept of work which was true during the last decades.
* Even though, many historical and social circumstances have been changed to the better, we are still facing huge challenges connected to the distribution of water, food, healthcare, wealth, power, education, basic human rights. the human collective cannot rest based on historical achievements and needs to envision new ideas for a shared future.   


### Beliefs

* Global challenges cannot be solved by nations. Even, if nations are the concepts we still live in. 
* Economy needs to become a mental model driven by responsibility, not growth. Otherwise it will make itself obsolete.
* The human being needs to learn to better integrate the idea of the individual and the idea of the collective. Both is valid.
* Historical linearity is a myth, not everything automatically will turn out to become better. Mankind has to envision more future ideas of itself.
* Collaboration is more important than competition for the human species.
* Technological and cultural progress need to be balanced, so that we can remain free in our decisions. That could mean, cultural progress needs to be speeded up.
* Historical concepts of power and growth need to be questioned, as they are not scalable anymore.
* It needs to be reflected in more depth and with more attention, on what we want for our children. Education needs to be reviewed towards its purpose.
