# theGRID Handbook

Welcome to the GRID HANDBOOK!

## About This Handbook

This Handbook's primary audience is the Grid Collective, Grid contributors or collaborators of the Grid.
For people who want to connect to the Grid, it can be used to get some insights in advance. 
The same goes for new members of the Grid Collective, the Handbook can be a good source of information parallel to the onboarding.

The Handbook is publicly available and we decided to use git for versioncontrol.
The reasons behind are simple - the Grid values transparency and collaboration.

We will change the Handbook incrementally. So expect that there is no final version.
Like the Grid itself, the Grid Handbook will be constantly changed.

## Scope

### Scope

The Handbook is a collection of concepts, processes and documents how the Grid collective approaches certain challenges.
The scope of the book is not written in stone, but it is meant to summarize the most important aspects of how we work together.
In addition to the _how_ we also want to illustrate some aspects of the _what_ and _why_ to give a better idea of the GRID.

The following sections reflect the scope as well.
