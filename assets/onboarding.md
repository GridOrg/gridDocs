# Onboarding


## In General

If you are new to the GRID, the first thing you should do is to introduce yourself.
Say hello via slack and take a look around. Please make sure to always reach out to your mentor, if there are any questions.

In slack you will find a welcome channel. This is a good place to drop a broadcast message to say 'hello'.

It is important not trying to consume all information, channels, tools, etc. at once, to not get lost in the rabbit hole.
Start in small steps, take your time and sync with your mentor to find the best next steps.


## For Subgrids

The subgrid mentor is taking care, that new subgrid members get introduced and involved.
A 1 on 1 (e.g. via skype) should be used to give an overview on the GRID and the specifics of the subgrid.

Each subgrid has additional communication channels or other tools to organize and collaborate.
For the onboarding the entry-level equipment should be defined, so that the new gridster is able to join.
The gridCore members are happy to help in providing access to tools or channels and also offer assistance during onboarding.

So if you were invited to a subgrid and start your GRID journey from there, then please keep in mind, that the gridCore people will always offer you a helping hand if there is anything you need. 


## Proposal Onboarding Plan

This onboarding plan is a template, which can be enhanced through the special subgrid needs.
Of course this plan has the purpose to assist and offer guidance, individually you (as a new gridster) can add more activity as you wish.

### Week 1

- The minimal equipment you need is an invitation to slack, so that you can get in touch 
- Please add some telling information to your slack profile, so that others are able to get an impression. It helps, if we use the same names throughout different channels / tools in the GRID. Perhaps you consider this during the user profile setup in tools and channels. 
- Say hello in the welcome channel and introduce yourself with a few words
- Make sure to plan a 1 on 1 with your mentor (either the subgrid mentor or the person who promoted you or someone of the coreGrid)
- Besides slack, the mentor will arrange, that you receive the necessary access to tools/channels based on what you discussed in the 1 on 1

Use the time to take a look around, to get to know some people. Just ping other people and say hello, if they did not ping you :)


### Week 2

- Make yourself familiar with the shared Calendar and Trello. We need both for a minimal approach for orga of shared todos and meetings.
- Try to prepare yourself for video calls. We use different ways here, but one standard way is skype. Your mentor is able to add you to the right groups there.
- Collect some questions you have during your first days in the GRID. What comes to your mind?
- Try to find a first project which raises your attention. This is important, since projects / intiatives / activities are the easiest way to join discussions and to get to know each other. Bring yourself into action and do not hesitate to ask others to join a project. If you need help in finding a suitable project, ask your mentor or someone out of the gridCore team.

### Week 3

- Think about some general contribution, perhaps, why not share what you found most interesting during week 1-2 in the slack channel _grid_
- Review your collected questions with your mentor and of course continue to collect new questions
- If you haven't found a project yet, take a look at the running challenges or the BOGI - perhaps you will find something here, what triggers your attention
- Make yourself familiar with the subgrids - are there any subgrids you might be interested in? Also, of course you can reach out to mentors of other subgrids to get some intro to what is going on in each subgrid
- Recap which tools and channels you are using so far. Try to go into further depth, for instance you could search for new slack channels which sound interesting to you 

### Week 4

- Read some more background infos connected to the GRID, a good collection is the GRID HANDBOOK, you can ask a gridCore team member or your mentor for a link
- Make yourself some thoughts about what your next steps are. As we are self-managed and not organized top-down, it is important to think about what you would like to do next. Where would you love to bring yourself in, which ideas are missing that you could share, which concepts could you improve with your skills and personality?
- Review the question list and try to get all answers in place. Use the whole GRID to get your questions answered.
- If you haven't so far, really try to find one starting project to join.
- Look at the calendar (of your subgrid or the GRID) and join a relevant video call to get to know some more people. A virtual beer is a good chance to connect.
