During the first months of the Grid, this first version was articulated as a draft. 
Depending on the further evolution of the Grid, the initial manifesto will be sooner or later updated to cover current thinking.

* The Grid Manifesto can be found on [github](https://github.com/GridOrg/grid-manifesto) or as page via [https://gridorg.github.io/grid-manifesto/](https://gridorg.github.io/grid-manifesto/)
