# Mentor Role

Any gridster who invites / promotes a new person for the GRID, should show own accountability and take the mentor role.
If that would not be possible, then a mentor needs to be named before the invite, so that we can ensure the support of new gridsters.
A natural mentor role is connected to the subgrids. Each subgrid has a mentor, typically the initiator of the subgrid.
That's why it makes sense, that gridsters who want to promote other people, sync beforehand with either the subgrid mentor or with a member of the coreGRID.
The coreGRID offers help in general to maintain procedures, like supporting onboarding. 

## Who Is Mentor?

* Each [subgrid](../gridMechanics/subgrids.md) has a mentor, who needs to serve the subgrid in various purposes
	* A subgrid's mentor is caring about the whole subgrid and can be recognized as a subgrid lead, as she/he shows main accountability for what happens in the subgrid
* A GRID member who promotes / invites other people to the GRID should be the mentor for this person. Only if that is not possible, another gridster (like a subgrid's mentor or a coreGRID team member) can be asked to take the mentor-role for the new recruit
* coreGRID team members offer assistance and will act as mentors in general. The mission is to maintain and support the GRID, and that is why coreGRID members are implicitly mentors.

## Purpose

A mentor tries to assist new team members or gridsters along their [onboarding](./onboarding.md) steps.
Mentors are important communication partners for new persons joining the GRID.

All mentors should be able to answer relevant questions, like ...

* What is the GRID?
* Which processes, agreements, routines etc. are important to know?
* Which accounts are needed as a minimal setup?
* What is a subgrid and which subgrids exist?
* How to contact others?
* What projects, intiatives, challenges are we working on?

... etc.

This Handbook can be a good preparation before taking the mentor role, since it aggregates the most relevant information. 

The mentor should also introduce the new person to other persons, so that social interaction is possible without artificial barriers.
1 on 1 meetings and introduction of the new person in group meetings should be what the mentor offers to care about the new gridster.

The purpose of the mentor is: **caring about new people in the GRID**

It makes sense, that gridsters who were mentors exchange their experiences, for instance in the context of onboarding. 
Because we should aim for a smooth and open welcome of new people in the GRID, we should learn from our approaches and improve the onboarding step by step.

## Responsibilities Of The Mentor

* The mentor is the facilitator of the [onboarding](./onboarding.md) and needs to assist new team members
* Offering support and help for new team mates
* Pro-Active introduction to other gridsters should be the duty of the mentor, especially if a new person is a bit shy or introverted
* The mentor should reach out actively to the new team member on a regular basis to verify if everything is ok, and to propose next steps 
* The mentor should take care about the team dynamics connected to new people as well - so awareness is important here
* A mentor should sync with other mentors (especially the subgrid mentor or the coreGRID) to exchange findings connected to onboarding
