## techGRID

The techGRID is the division of the GRID when it's about technology, engineering, breaking down problems into chunks, conception, thinking, making things happen. 
We are the builders guilde of the GRID, if you like. 

What we do is creation; what we create is driven by curiosity, fun, challenge or purpose. 
Our agenda will evolve incrementally thorugh the projects and discussions incrementally.
For the GRID, one common sense is the existence of the need for utopian concepts. 
As the techGRID, we question the present status quo as the purest mindset of the engineer.

As a subgrid of the GRID, we are interwinded with other subgrids.
As the GRID is made of subgrids, we form the GRID.

### Intro to the techGRID

The techGRID has been launched as one of the first subgrids.
This of course is a statement.

One believe in the GRID is, that social beings do not require technology to live a good life.
The other believe is, that for the human species, our future progress and survival will not be possible anymore without technological progress.

Technology and movements connected to technological progress, like the open source movement, have become a major cultural driver for society.
Zeitgeist is not influenced by non-technological thinking anymore. And this is important to recognize and to use as a starting point for the techGRID.

The techGRID shall spawn new concepts, new thinking, new answers to old problems perhaps.
In the techGRID we are not influenced by any dominant form of media, no politician party, no company, no lobbyist.
That is why we form the GRID as subgrid named techGRID.

We believe in the unix philosophy of modular and extensible design. And so is the GRID.
There is one the thing, we want to do well - being the techGRID. 
Every subgrid will emit input, but even more - every GRID member, and so every techGRID member, will influence the shape of the GRID to come.

Pragmatically, we start iterate from here to there. Let's see where we will end up.
