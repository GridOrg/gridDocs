## techGRID

The techGRID is the division of the GRID when it's about technology, engineering, breaking down problems into chunks, conception, thinking, making things happen. 
We are the _builders guilde of the GRID_, if you like. 

What we do is creation. 
what we create, is motivated by curiosity, fun, a challenge or purpose. 
Our agenda will evolve incrementally through our projects and discussions.

For the GRID, we all agree that there is a huge need for utopian concepts to envision the future.
As the techGRID, we question the present status quo with the mindset of the engineer, who challenges what there is through building the imagineable.


As the GRID is made of all individuals forming [subgrids](../gridMechanics/subgrids.md), together we constitute the GRID.
As we are a subgrid of the GRID, we are interwinded with other subgrids.
Through the GRID, we exchange ideas, practices and share infrastructures.



### Intro To The techGRID

The techGRID has been launched as one of the first subgrids. This of course is a statement. 
Together with the artGrid, the techGrid is focussed on creativity and creation skills, besides analysis and thinking. 

We think, that social beings do not require technology to live a good life.
But we also think, that the future progress of the human species and its survival will not be possible anymore without technological progress.

Progress in the tech communities, like the open source community, influenced the overall thinking and made mass contribution to culture and society possible.
Zeitgeist is heavily influenced by the tech community. And this is important to recognize and to use as a starting point for the techGRID.
We want to contribute, share projects open source and to collaborate with others.

The techGRID shall spawn concepts, new thinking, answers to existing problems and it will raise new questions.
Gridsters of the techGRID we are not influenced by any dominant form of media, no politician party, no company, no lobbyist.
We believe in the unix philosophy of modular and extensible design. And so is the GRID.
Every subgrid is emitting ideas, but even more - every GRID member, and so every techGRID member, will influence the shape of the GRID to come.
As the techGRID we take the challenge to influence the GRID based on the engineers attitude and with the output we generate with our projects.

Pragmatically, we start in a small setup, with a first project, then iterate from there. Let's see where we will end up.
