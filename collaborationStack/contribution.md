# Contribution

Contribution is extremely important for the GRID as we all want to collaborate.

Some aspects needs to be highlighted, so that contribution can be cultivated in a max. healthy way ...



## Be Open - Let Others Contribute In Your Project

The GRID aims for collaboration and inclusion, not exclusion.
As the GRID is a collective, it is not a one-man-show. Let others contribute to your project or effort.
That others are able to contribute does not mean, that you are about to lose control about your work.


If you consider yourself as an author of a text for example, then you can point out your intention for the text.
Be clear about your ambitions and define precisely which kind of contribution you prefer.
People will respect your intention and therefore you as the initial author, but you need to care about the communication and clarify what is important for you and the text.

Let others join, let others share their opinion, let others contribute. 
But then be patient, if the contribution not working out in the way you hoped.
Not any contribution has to be accepted. Explain yourself, if you do not accept something.

Contribution is not meant to be the right to highjack any kind of project for individual purposes.
On the other hand, the GRID is a collaborative structure. Without contribution the value of projects will be decreased.

So the recommendation is - be open for the opinion of others, but clarify which criteria are important for 'good' contributions.
Be fair and pro-active, but also patient.


## If You Want To Contribute / Pre-Requisites

Contribution requires empathy.

When others ask the collective for contribution to a project, they do not mean, that the project should be randomly changed into whatever ...
Typically, people are asking others for help on certain aspects. They do not want to hand out everything. And that is normal.
Think about a painting you paint ... you don't want others to come along and start painting a totally different painting on top of your original one.
That would piss off the initial author.

So if one of us joins a project, we need to make sure that we understood which contribution is needed.

If someone is working on a text, for instance, then she/he spent a lot of thoughts potentially.
Now, if you want to join with the ambition to contribute, then some aspects should be considered:

- Make sure, you really made yourself familiar with the work that was already done by the other person(s). Jumping in and proposing changes wildly without knowing what others already discussed is not polite and not respectful. So first of all, make sure to respect the intial efforts and authorship of others, before you jump in. You could also ask the author or initiator of a project, for which aspects contribution is needed right now.
- Ask the project group, if there are any reviewing processes for changes. Or any important criteria to keep in mind. 
- Respect, that your proposed changes would be reviewed by the initial author or the project team. It is important to understand, that contribution is not meant to be the highjacking of the work of others for the own sake.
- Try to leave your EGO out of the contribution. We are aiming for discussions on arguments and need to stay productive based on multiple opinions. So if you propose changes or additions, take into consideration that the group or the initial author will not approve it. This is nothing personal. If you feel bad about such a situation, try to search the dialogue. 

A common sense for the concept of contribution should be, that we help each other on the basis of respect and that we aim for productive collaboration.
