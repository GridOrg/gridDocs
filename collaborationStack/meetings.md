## Regular Meetings

We use a global event calendar to plan GRID meetings or events, so that other gridsters are informed.

The regular day for GRID Meetings is Thursday. 
In the evening we meet for a virtual beer.

## Topic Related Meetings

If there is a need to discuss a certain project, challenge, todo, idea or any kind of important topic, people are of course pro-active to arrange a meeting with the relevant persons.

## Meet-Ups

Sometimes we meet physically.
This is connected to a real location and so not everyone is able to join, perhaps.
If we want to arrange a meet-and-greet event for all gridsters, we need to organize this early enough.
