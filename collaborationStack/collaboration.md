## Collaboration

A key ingredient of the GRID is collaboration.

### Individual vs. Collective

The GRID is about collective collaboration. But in addition to that, the individual minds and the unique personalities are valued.
This leads to the need that we have to balance out individuality and collective mechanisms.
For collaboration, this is important to keep in mind.

In this context some aspects can be reflected ...

* There will always be a situation which leads to potential conflicts. Conflicts are to solve, not to prevent in any case. Because we want to grow and learn.
* Critical thinking quickly can be surpressed if happiness and politeness are the most dominant parameters of a team culture. We want to create ideas, not smiling faces alone. Some ideas will be challenging. 
* We don't have to agree in all aspects, that is simply not necessary. But we have to agree, that the ability to exchange multiple opinions is good.
* The subject influences the collective (passive or active influence), the collective on the other side has an implicit normative effect on how the individuals does what. Both is valid, but we need to be aware of this circular connection to make something useful out of it.
* As collective, We should always be open to search for the best arguments, the most touching ideas, the most valuable or relevant approaches - it is not about **who is right**, it is about **what seems to be best** based on what we know or based on the arguments we discuss.
* Sharing of information and the openness towards new thoughts will be a collective foundation, which can be super valuable on an individual level.
* Every gridster is free to opt-out, if the collective offering is not suitable. That is important to mention, because we need to deeply understand, that each of the gridster contributes on a voluntary level. Blaming what all volunteers are doing, is a NO-GO! Only constructive proposals can be a vehicle to change what pisses one off. So only contribution can be the medium to change the organism. Trolling, poisoning of thoughts, blaming, bullying and similar behavious are not compatible to the GRID. Emotional positioning in the context of constructive thoughts is fully ok, as we are all human.
* To create and sustain an environment in which thoughts can be articulated and discussed, it is more important to show respect to others than to pretend artificial politeness. But of course each social environment is a better place to be if all people also focus on enjoyable relationships instead of frustration. We should act by reason and aiming for something which is enjoyable.
* The collective is the organism which can create a huge impact to the world. But the soul of the collective is the subject. That is why the correct picture of the GRID collective is the co-existence of multiple entities which together form a virtual body. A wrong assumption of the GRID collective would be the picture of a homogeneous mass of centrally controlled entities. The design of the GRID is conceptualized to integrate subject and collective into a meaningful co-existence. Neither the collective is right, nor the subject. Only both is true. For the collaboration methodologies this implies a lot. For instance, that mass consensus is not the only truth. For instance, that normative aspects need to be understood as service for the subject, not as power to fit the subject into the big picture. And so on ... In conclusion, the GRID has to be and to remain a LAB for collaboration. A lab which researches on ways to integrate the collective and individual needs and potentials. More than that, we are convinced, that this is needed for the entire world. 

Without having a code of conduct, we aim for some behavioural attitudes, which makes collaboration easier:

- Show respect
- Respect diversity
- Be open for new ideas
- Discuss through arguments
- Allow emotional behaviour
- Accept failure
- Accept wrong assumptions
- Trade thoughts
- Focus on conclusions or experiments
- Discuss concerns, but let other make the point first
- Do not try to moderate each and every bit, because this reduces authenticity
- Be aware of the channel you use, for instance: solving conflicts via e-mail most probably will not be successful
- Leave if you want to leave, but understand that this is communication, too
- Try to be fair
- Aim for reason
- Remember, that all others are there to collaborate with you


### Decision Making

Decisions are necessary in various constellations. If a group is not able to decide how to move forward, then it might be that there will not be a move forward.
There are several questions connected to a decision making process.

Like:

* How to make decisions, if the participation of (for instance) a voting-procedure is low?
* Which apsects require consensus, which aspects require a critical mass of supporters?
* Which apsects are best maneuvered through representation and which aspects require a voting of all involved?
* For which aspects would you prefer a veto-approach and how would this be operationalized?
* Which aspects are just part of the individual or daily decision making and which aspects vitally require a buy-in of the group?
* How does the right balance between openness for incremental evolution and agreement of foundational approaches look like?
* What positive or negative impact can decision making create for the individual flexibility or the autonomy of subgrids?
* Who triggers which kind of decision making process?

etc.

In the GRID we have not answered all questions and most certainly will never do.

But that an organism needs to be able to move forward, is not to debate.
We learned in early meetings, that consensus based on the assumption that most people will contribute with their vote is highly inefficient.
Two consequences came out here. First, sometimes it's better to let things go and wait for veto than to wait for consensus and do nothing.
Second, some aspects could be decided in the group of people who participate in a vote to achieve a commons sense. In other words, focussing on the critical mass of people who are willing to contribute with their votes is better than waiting for all people who perhaps do not even care about the outcome.

For aspects this learning could not be applied, since there will always be the need for decisions of a higher impact, which should be driven by consensus within the significant part of the collective. A good practice is, that such votes are triggered by the collective. 
To give an example, if there is a current way of doing things, a common practice which people want to challenge or change. Then this could be raised, as some sort of veto-approach or change-request. 

This finally means, that there are two types of trigger for decision making processes.

1) A decision needs to be made to move forward. The people who want to move forwards trigger a vote. This vote is either oriented after a timely approach, so that a critical mass is preferred. OR the vote requires a broader consensus, so that the ambition has to be to involve a significant number of gridster to contribute with their opinion. 
2) A current practice is questioned. A veto has to be raised in form of a change-request. In best case, a constructive proposal would be added to illustrate what could be done better.

Both approaches could be applied to the dimension of a subgrid or also for the entire GRID.
Global GRID-approaches should be raised towards the [coreGrid](../gridCORE/gridCore.md), so that the facilitation of a general change can be supported. This would also be important, to allow a double check on the possible aspects to consider. For example, if the change would affect the standard communication routines, then of course the gridCore needs to change everything in consequence by its administrative function. Another example is, that some changes might cause the need to inform all gridsters on new practicalities. To ensure this to happen, the gridCore has to be involved. Finally, the overall maintenance of this GRID only can be ensured by giving the gridCORE a veto right on requests for change. A veto needs to be well argumented in any case and has to be communicated of course.



#### Voting

There are tools to do quick polls or even surveys.
Voting in regards to the ambition of consensus is also driven by the mechanics behind.
There are concepts of liquid democracy for instance, which we think are a better fit to most problems than classical votings.

Today, we do not have the one golden standard. And it is to question that there will be the only one answer to consensus.
That's why we try to be open for many approaches and in addition to that we want to become a laboratory for challenges connected to consensus.

Voting, as a more or less quantitative approach, is one thing.
The other, perhaps more important foundation, is the qualitative discussion of topics.
That's where we invest more.

Depending on the GRID's size and complexity, it can become inefficient for the decision making process to focus on the qualitative debate.
That's why we always need to be open for approaches connected to voting, consensus, decision making.

If you think of [budgeting or co-funding](../gridCORE/funding.md) then the context of a collaborative way to decide a budget could be explained like:

1) You need a funding of an initiative and promote it to the group, you also show what the funding target is
2) The group is able (on an individual basis) to discuss the initiative and spend a certain amount of budget to fund the initiative
3) The timeline for the funding is determined, if the goal is achieved, the budget would be in place. If not, then the funding was not successful.

NOTE: If budgets (like, based on artificial tokens / points as internal currency for weighting / value expression) or real money is collected, depends on the case. Today, the GRID has no financial backing and is non-commercial. As such, there is no real budget to spend. If the need will show up, we have to find ways of how to deal with funding and budget-assessment. This is already a preparational task of the gridCORE, but is also connected to legal and compliance aspects, so that we do not tackle this until the day we really need it.

#### Qualification of Initiatives

If a subgrid wants to discuss [initiatives](../gridMechanics/initiatives.md), there are no formal rules of how this needs to happen.
This is the case, because of the autonomy of the subgrids.

But in any subgrid there will evolve the need to sort out which shared initiative will become hot or not.

The [BOGI](../gridMechanics/bogi.md) is one of the existing approaches, which easily can be adapted by subgrids to qualify ideas or initiatives on the subgrids agenda.
Here is also a small text related to the [promotion of ideas](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/HOW-TO-PROMOTE-AN-IDEA-nm0SFRwHpT96wkxZeSBgA).

Every gridster needs to deeply understand, that every idea counts. Perhaps even the bad ideas ;)
The promotion of ideas is not about ego, it is about assisting the idea to grow. 
For the group discussion of ideas, it is important to respect other opinions and to focus on arguments.
Only the qualitative discussion of many ideas will open up new opportunities for the individual and for the group.

Then again it is clear, that the GRID (or subgrid) impact is only real, if ideas will be realized.
That is why the qualification of ideas needs to be also driven by the will to realize something.
Having a minimal or lean approach of assessment in place, makes life easier. 

Voting is perhaps not always the best approach, but can be.
The discussion of what a subgrid wants to achieve is a good foundation for the assessment of new ideas in the group.

Finally. The battle of ideas should be fun. So be curious, which ideas will be brought up.
