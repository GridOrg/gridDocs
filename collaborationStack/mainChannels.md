## Main Channels

The most important channels we use, are:

* Slack for various purposes and chat
* Trello for collecting ideas or planning
* Video calls (for example via skype or appear.in) to replace physical presence and meet for a virtual beer

For the coordination of events (like meetings) global calendars of course help us to organize.

### New Gridster hints

If you are new to the GRID, the most important aspect is to get to know some people.
Get in touch with your mentor, most probably the person who invited you or the mentor of the subgrid you are in.
Introduce yourself and get to know some faces via video call.

Once you enter slack, you usually see only a minimal set of channels.
That is normal to not overwhelm you after the first login.
Find your way through the rabbit-hole and search for channels which might sound interesting to you.

Subgrids are also represented with slack channels, but you need an invite.
That is not to exclude you, but to support the autonomy of the subgrids and to focus on relevant participation.

Ask your mentor which events should be known. For instance, which regular meetings are relevant?

After a while, you should have mastered your first steps through the [toolbelt](./collaborationStack.md) of the GRID and know the most relevant channels for the start.
The next best step would be: find an initiative, action, discussion on which you would like to contribute.
And never forget to introduce yourself to the others - they are happy to see a new gridster on board.
Don't be shy, be explorative and ask your mentor any question you want.


### Main Trello Boards

In Trello the GRID is organized in a team.
All boards of the team can be found on the team page.

The most frequented boards usually are the BOGI and Orga boards.
But the boards connected to the GRID AGENDA or the GRID VALUES are very important as well.

New gridsters are free to explore whatever they want, if access is not blocked (which usually is not the case).
The amount of texts, cards, channels, chats etc. we have produced over time, is relatively high.
So focussing on the most important channels is at least important during the first steps to not get lost.
